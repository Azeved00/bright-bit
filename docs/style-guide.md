# Style Guide

This theme is focusend on keeping most items monocromatic 
and then having key itens pop with bright and bold colors.

Furthermore there is a focus on screen realspace,
avoiding large borders and using descriptive items
whenever doing so doesn't sacrifice readibility.

Note #1: some ports were developed before this style guide so
they might not be in accordance.

Note #2: this follows my personal style and how I like my computer to look.
